# Repository description
Just a collection of instructions and my reports for the course Advanced Computer Vision Methods (ULJ-FRI). Too lazy to clean up the code so it's presentable.

## Topics

- Optical flow
- Mean-shift tracking
- Correlation filter tracking
- Motion models, Kalman filters, tracking with Particle filters
- Long-term tracking with SiamFC
