# Repository description
A collection of my schoolwork that is in a presentable format (reports or/and code) for my studies at ULJ-FRI (small part undergrad and most of masters program). Included are simple homeworks, solo and group projects. Everything is either in this repository or links to other repositories. If code isn't included, said homework included a lot of boiler-plate/framework code that was provided and wasn't written by me or the group I was a part of.
